[Intro Scene: In child’s bedroom]
[Setting: Joseph and Vy are putting their two kids to sleep]

Boy: Daddy daddy! tell us a bedtime story!
Girl: yeah, I’m not sleepy yet - all your stories are the best at putting me to sleep!
Jo: Hmm... I don’t know if there are many stories left I haven’t told you kids.
Boy: Well, you’ve never told us the story of how you and mommy married!
Girl: Ooh yay! That sounds romantic!
boy: *giggle*
Girl: *giggle*
Jo: oh wow, I think you’re right! – it’s actually pretty romantic - ha,  I guess I’ve been saving the best for last!
(Vy looks confused)

[Engagement Scene Start (Joseph)]
[Background: On the Pacific Ocean]
[Setting: Joseph and Vy are on a Cruise ship on way to Alaska]

Jo: Being the devilish charmer that I am, I took care of all the  planning, I booked a beautiful cruse along the coast up to the Alaskan wilderness.

[See ship sail off into horizon]

[Engagement Scene Start (Joseph)]
[Background: The top peak of a snowy mountain]
[A helicopter lands ad the peak, and Joseph and Vy Hop out]

Jo (Narration): We took a helicopter ride up to the top of a pristine glacier. As we jumped off the helipad, revealing the georgous view, i turned toward vy, and totally surprised her with the largest diamond you can only dream of. Totally surprised, her knees got weak, she fell into my arms and cried out yes. 

(Joseph does a cool proposal twist, kneeling down and turns to Vy)
(Zoom in shot of Vy’s face, as she turns, and the wind blows thru her hair romantically (slow-mo shot))

Vy: Oh Joseph yes! A thousand times yes!

[Child’s bedroom]
 
Boy: Amazing daddy!
Girl: Oh, how romantic!
Vy: Ha, ha, ha, ...(now laughing loudly) HA HA HA! Oh boy. Kids, your father is either delusional or lost his mind. This is the way it really went down:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Starting Vacation (Vy)
[Background: Pacific Ocean]
[Setting: On a delapadated ship sailing to Hawaii]

Vy (Narration): He found the cheapest ship that could get us from point A to point B, heavily beaten up and barely afloat - the entire time I was worrying that we might all drown.

[Joseph is nauseous puking over the side.]

[Alaskan Proposal (Vy)]
[Background: muddy dirty brown hills, snow melting and wet Setting: Joseph and Vy are slowly hiking up a path]

Vy (Narration): After spending the night in a shack, we hicked up a trail – your father is too cheap to pay for transportation - the path was melting and brown - a pretty pathetic sight. out of nowhere in the middle of the dump he casually popped the question.

Jo: Oh by the way Babe... Uh.. you wanna marry me?
Vy: (looking stunned) Are you proposing to me?!? In this disgusting brown dump?!

[As Vy yells at Jo, she slowly pushes the argument down the trail]

Jo: yeah?...
(pausing stares)
Vy: In this soggy wasteland?!
Jo: I guess so?

(Joseph and Vy stare at each other for a moment, Vy is expending a response.)

Joseph: (breaking the silence) Yes please.
(Vy pauses her response)
Vy: Ok, but we’ll make up a more romantic version of this to tell people.
(Vy & Joseph both look up to the sky [transition to next scene])

[Back in childrens bedroom] 
[Jo and Vy are talking over eachother arguing]

Jo: Whoh whoh whoh - it was nothing even remotely that bad!
Vy: -Oh, you’re just misremembering dear-
Jo: -No, i have a pretty good memory of things, and I have receipts and tickets and pictures as evidence to prove the events that actually transpired- 
Vy: -Well, Maybe - maybe it was somewhere in the middle.

(Look to see the kids asleep) 
(fade to picture of jo & vy proposal)
